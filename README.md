CRUD
====

Simple CRUD app involving JSP, Servlet, HTML, Javascript, jQuery(it fetched .js library from CDN so make you are connected to web).
It uses tomcat as servlet container, MySql as DB and BootStrap for UI.
I have implemented SSL on this app(locally), for explaination on this, head to my blog "http://abhi-singh.co.nr/" and search for TLS.
